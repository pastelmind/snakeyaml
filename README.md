## Disclaimer

This is a fork of [SnakeYAML](https://bitbucket.org/asomov/snakeyaml/). I created this repository for my CS453 assignment. My changes are contained in the `pitest` branch.

Here are some links to files of interest in this repository:

* [`DumperOptions.java`](./src/main/java/org/yaml/snakeyaml/DumperOptions.java#L240):
  Source file that contains two surviving mutations generated by [PIT](https://pitest.org/).
* [`DumperOptionsTest.java`](./src/test/java/org/yaml/snakeyaml/DumperOptionsTest.java#L173):
  This test case was updated to kill the mutations found in the above.
* [PIT-generated report for the original test suite](https://pastelmind.github.io/snakeyaml/target/pit-reports/202004271623/)

## Overview ##
[YAML](http://yaml.org) is a data serialization format designed for human readability and interaction with scripting languages.

SnakeYAML is a YAML 1.1 processor for the Java Virtual Machine version 7.
For YAML 1.2 (which is a superset of JSON) you may have a look at [SnakeYAML Engine](https://bitbucket.org/asomov/snakeyaml-engine)

## SnakeYAML features ##

* a **complete** [YAML 1.1 processor](http://yaml.org/spec/1.1/current.html). (If you need YAML **1.2** support have a look [here](https://bitbucket.org/asomov/snakeyaml-engine)). In particular, SnakeYAML can parse all examples from the specification.
* Unicode support including UTF-8/UTF-16 input/output.
* high-level API for serializing and deserializing native Java objects.
* support for all types from the [YAML types repository](http://yaml.org/type/index.html).
* relatively sensible error messages.
